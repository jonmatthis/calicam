# Overview

Individual and stereo camera calibration is now operating within a PyQt GUI. The next stage of development is to integrate the calibration data into a single unified system that can be allow integration of all stereolocated point locations.

Before tackling the larger task, I will take a smaller step by doing 3d tracking of a charuco board fron one stereocamera perspective. The next step will be to change the frame of reference of the board position based on a set origin. 

After the above is done, then I believe that the multicamera workflow will become much less mysterious.
