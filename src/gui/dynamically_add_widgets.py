# This module builds off of the tutorial above to add in widgets to a central
# scroll area. My hope is that this will provide the foundation for the various
# video display widgets while moving through the camera setup calibration
# and capture process.

# There should also, I believe, but a window to assess the quality of the 
# calibration using the Charuco. Is the ultimate reconstruction of the 
# charuco flat and of the same dimensions as the real one?
